# Projects for CS3283/4

### 1. Event Video Stitching and Sharing

The goal of the project is to develop a video sharing website organized around events.  Event attendees can post their videos of the events.  Gathering many video clips that are shot simultaneously at the same venue, but from different angles, allow the system to create a more engaging, crowdsourced version of the event video, by automatically selecting and stitching the selected videos together.

### 2. More Engaging Tutorial during eLearning Week

Existing remote conference software support lecture delivery very well. For conducting a tutorial, where the tutor writes on the white board and facilitates discussion among students, however, there is no good solution. The goal of this project is to design a system that is easy to setup, easy to use, and effective in supporting e-learning for tutorial sessions.

This is an open-ended project: multiple teams can take up this project and propose/implement different solutions.

### 3. Automated Organization and Summary of Scanned Bills and Statements

A person who scans his phone bills/medical bills/banks statements often has to manually file the scanned images/PDF. The bills/statements from one organization, however, typically have the same layout and format and it is possible to automatically classify the bills (e.g., based on the logo) and file them into appropriate folders. Further, it is possible to read information (such as the amount of phone usage) from the PDF/images and summarize them (e.g., show a chart of phone usage month-over-month). In this project, the students will build a Web application that allows users to upload their scanned documents and present the documents in categories with summary automatically.

### 4. BComp(CS) Study Planner

This project aims to assist students in study planning, as well as the department in module planning.  Students can file their 4-year study plan online and adjust them along the way.  The system should provide guidance to students regarding module prerequisites and recommends interesting and relevant modules for students.  From module planning perspective, the system allow administrators to collect data and analyze the needs of the students, and analyze the effect of a curriculum change on the students.

### 5. Simplify Video Scribing

Video Scribing, also known as Whiteboard Video, is an engaging way to explain things to audience.  Such videos are particularly useful in the context of MOOCs.  See the [MinutePhysics YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/minutephysics) for great examples. Video scribing, however, can be very time consuming to plan, record, and edit.  The goal of this project is to design and implement a system that is easy for video producer to plan, record, and edit such videos.

This is an open-ended project: multiple teams can take up this project and propose/implement different solutions.

### 6. STePS Networking Module

SoC term Project Showcase (STePS) System has event workflow management, registration, check-in and voting modules. As the event is getting bigger, we would like to enhance the system with a networking module to enable attendees to network meaningfully and effectively before, during and after events. The module should classify/group users based on their interest and purpose of attending STePS, allow users to post/comment in forums of each STePS run, have personal chat with other attendees. You are required to design, develop and integrate the module with STePS system.
